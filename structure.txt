overall design for how to program the game (work in progess)


order of execution

player gets program message description

while (player.wins < 3) and (npc.wins < 3) {

player chooses Pokemon
    gets input
    assigns pokemon to player

computer chooses pokemon

compare pc.pokemon with npc.pokemon
    if compare pc.pokemon.strength == npc.pokemon.weakness
        player wins!
        player.wins++
    else
        npc wins!
        npc.wins++

}

if player.wins == 3
    print win screen.
        print("You beat the rival trainer!")
else if npc.wins == 3
    print lose screen
        print("You lost to your rival!")
else
    print("How did you get here?")

exit the program




    could take in bool win variable?

    if win:
        //checks player pokemon.weakness
        if weakness == 1
            choose pokemon.strength == 1
        else if weakness == 2
            choose pokemon with strength 2
        else if weakness == 3
            choose pokemon with strength 3
    else:
        if player.strength == 1:
            choose pokemon with weakness == 1
        else if player.strength == 2:
            choose pokemon with weakness == 2
        else if player.strength == 3:
            choose pokemon with weakness 3






Using object oriented programming, which means using classes

***Classes***

player class
    has a pokemon
    int wins




***Functions***

player: select pokemon
computer: select pokemon

select pokemon(player)
    assigns a pokemon to the input.
    player put in? assigns pokemon to player
    computer put in?  assigns pokemon to player

    //player gets first dibs.  Could remove the chosen pokemon from the list of available pokemon?
    //check pass by reference vs pass by pointer?
    //need to pass in a class (player/computer)

compare pokemon(player, comp)
    takes in player and computer
    compares strength and weakness

    //could represent strength and weakness of pokemon as numbers.
    if player.pokemon.strength == computer.pokemon.weakness
        player wins!
    else if player.pokemon.weakness == computer.pokemon.strength
        computer wins!
    else
        tie!
