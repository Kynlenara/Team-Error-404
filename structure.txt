overall design for how to program the game (work in progess)

order of execution

player gets program message description

while (player.wins < 3) and (npc.wins < 3) {

player chooses Pokemon
    gets input
    assigns pokemon to player

computer chooses pokemon

compare pc.pokemon with npc.pokemon
    if compare pc.pokemon.strength == npc.pokemon.weakness
        player wins!
        player.wins++
    else
        npc wins!
        npc.wins++

}

if player gets three wins
    print win screen.

else if npc wins
    print lose screen

exit the program
